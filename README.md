Salary grid of OPEO Studio

We believe in transparency and openness, so we are open sourcing our salary grid.

--------------------------------------------------
The SALARY GRID represents the salary of the full-time contributors & founders @ OPEO Studio.

For example,

- A junior profile wants to join OPEO Studio full time
- The required experience is less than 2 years
- Hence, the salary will be 20K as per the grid

--------------------------------------------------
The EQUITY FACTOR is the factor by which the equity of everyone joining OPEO Studio is calculated.

For example, 

- the current valuation of OPEO Studio is 11 million, the equity factor is 0.1.
- A senior profile (VP) is joining with a base equity of 2%
- Hence, the proposed equity will be of 2%*0.1 = 0.2%

---------------------------------------------------


As everything else, this is the first batch of salaries and responsibilities and is subject to change. Feedbacks welcome.
